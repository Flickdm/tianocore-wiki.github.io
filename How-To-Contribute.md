# How To Contribute

Our community enables

related to the [EDK II](http://www.tianocore.org/edk2/) project, so if
you are developer, then this is a good place to start contributing to
our community.

UEFI developers are the primary focus of our community, but if you are
interested in trying to use UEFI, then we have a page on how to
