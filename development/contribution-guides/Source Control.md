# Source Control

Subversion is currently the primary source control system we use.
However, as each individual project may choose its own source control
system, you should refer to the project's page to find the official
source control location.

## Mirrors

In a few cases, some source control mirrors are available. However,
these mirrors are **not** officially supported.
