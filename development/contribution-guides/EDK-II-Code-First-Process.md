# EDK II Code First Process

The EDK II Code First Process is a process by which new features can be added
to UEFI Forum specifications after first having been designed and prototyped
in the open.

This process lets changes and the development of new features happen in the
open, without violating the UEFI forum bylaws which prevent publication of
code for in-draft features/changes.

The process does not in fact change the UEFI bylaws - the change is that the
development (of both specification and code) happens in the open. The resulting
specification update is then submitted to the appropriate working group as an
Engineering Change Request (ECR), and voted on. For the UEFI Forum, this is a
change in workflow, not a change in process.

## UEFI Forum Tracking

ECRs are tracked in a [UEFI Forum Mantis](https://mantis.uefi.org/) instance,
with access restricted to UEFI Forum Members.

## TianoCore Tracking

TianoCore enables this process by using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/features/issues)
to track specification updates, reference implementations, and any other
associated changes, such as links to content within the [TianoCore GitHub](https://github.com/tianocore)
organization, related to the "code first" change.

Code first implementation targeting the EDK II open source project are initially
held in draft pull requests within a TianoCore GitHub repository.

## Intended workflow

1. Create a new GitHub issue in the primary TianoCore repository for the change using the "Code First" form.
   - Note: The primary repository will most frequently be [edk2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2).
   - Note: Ensure all specifications impacted by the change are selected in the form.
     - Note: A specification draft change must be included in a markdown file in the "code first dev branch". A file
       must be present for each specification if more than one specification is impacted by the change. Base the file
       content on the template in the Code First GitHub issue submission form.
2. Make the changes in a new branch with the prefix `GI####-<BranchName>` that
   meets the content requirements for the code first process described in this document.
    - Note: `####` in `GI####` is the GitHub issue number from *step 1*.
    - Note: `<BranchName>` is a brief description of the change.
    - Note: Code content must follow the coding style and naming conventions in
      the [Source Code](#source-code) section of this document.
    - Note: Code first pull requests may have PR checks performed to verify that these requirements are met.
3. Push the "code first dev branch" to either:
    1. A fork of the primary repository (e.g. `username/edk2`)
    2. A branch in [edk2-staging](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-staging).

       Consider this branch a collaboration point for yourself and others that may contribute to the change.
        - If you use a fork of the primary repository, ensure that the fork is public. You may grant permisssions to
          your fork branch as needed for others to collaborate there.
        - If you use an `edk2-staging` branch, you might need to reach out to an edk2-staging maintainer so they can
          grant permissions to the users that need to push changes there.
          - If you do not have write permission, in the "Anything else?" box of the GitHub issue in *step 1*, notify the
            admins with `@tianocore/tianocore-admins` and list the GitHub usernames for all collaborators that need
            permission to the `edk2-staging` branch.
4. Create a draft pull request into the default branch on the repository from the "code first dev branch" (*step 3*).
   - Apply the `type:code-first` label to the PR.
5. Add a comment in the PR with a link to the GitHub issue created in *step 1*.
   - It is also recommended to link the pull request to the issue following the methods described in
[Linking a pull request to an
issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
6. Continue to develop the change in the "code first dev branch" until it is ready for review. Changes pushed to the
   branch will automatically update the PR.
7. After all dependent specification changes have been approved and publicly published, the PR with code changes is
   eligible for review. Mark the PR as ready for review when code changes are final (so it is taken out of draft
   status).
8. Reviewers will review the PR and provide feedback.
9. Make changes based on feedback and continue to iterate until the change is ready to be merged.
10. A maintainer will merge the PR after the change is approved.

If the change impacts repsoitories other than edk2, such as integration changes in
[edk2-platforms](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms), those changes should
be kept in a branch on a fork of the repository and the PR process described above
should be followed in that repository as well.

Any other relevant branches, issues, discussions, or forks should be linked to the issue in *step 1*.

When the change is ready for review, the PR should be marked as ready for review (taken out of draft status).

### Edk2-Staging Branch and the Draft Pull Request

Something to be aware of is that two parts of the code first process are constant to simplify finding and contributing
to code first changes.

1. Regardless of the decision made in *step 3*, a `GI####-<BranchName>` branch will always exist in `edk2-staging`.
2. A draft PR linked to the GitHub issue in *step 1* will always exist in the primary repository.

If the contributor opts to use a fork of the primary repository in *step 3*, an automated process will sync updates to
the `GI####-<BranchName>` branch in `edk2-staging` any time the draft PR is updated. Thus, even if you do not have
write permission to `edk2-staging` your branch will still be created there and kept up to date on your behalf. Be aware
that in this case, the "code first dev branch" is still the branch on the fork as that is the PR branch.

## Source Code

In order to ensure draft code does not accidentally leak into production use,
and to signify when the changeover from draft to final happens, *all* new or
modified lines must have a comment in the following format:

`[CODE_FIRST] <IssueId>`

> Note: "BEGIN" and "END" comment markers are not allowed. Each line must have a comment.

- `<IssueId>`  is a placeholder for the GitHub Code First issue for the change
  - For example, if the GitHub issue is `10000`, the comment in C source code should be `// [CODE_FIRST] 10000`
- This process does not prescribe how the comment is positioned relative to other code on the line. The comment
  may have any number of surrounding whitespace characters to meet aesthetic preference or code formatting requirements.
- If multiple code first changes affect the same area of code each line should be unique to a given code first change
  with its corresponding comment. If for any reason two code first changes must be on the same line, the comment for each
  code first change should be placed at the end of the line.
