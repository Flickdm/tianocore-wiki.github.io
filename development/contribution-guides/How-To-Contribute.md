# How To Contribute

Our community enables
[UEFI](UEFI) firmware and tools
through various open source projects. Most of our efforts are currently
related to the [EDK II](http://www.tianocore.org/edk2/) project, so if
you are developer, then this is a good place to start contributing to
our community.

UEFI developers are the primary focus of our community, but if you are
interested in trying to use UEFI, then we have a page on how to
[start using UEFI](start_using_UEFI).

There are several ways to participate in our community. Anyone can join
our
[Mailing
Lists](Mailing_Lists) to discuss UEFI related topics.

  [https://tianocore-docs.github.io/EDK_II_Secure_Code_Review_Guide/draft/](https://tianocore-docs.github.io/EDK_II_Secure_Code_Review_Guide/draft/)
  prior to submitting a patch, along with creating a unit test and
  performing some static analysis
- Recommend following some of the practices at
  [1](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/)

- If a proposed set of patches also requires a change to
  [UEFI](UEFI) or other
  industry standard specifications, then use the
  [EDK II Code First Process](EDK_II_Code_First_Process).
