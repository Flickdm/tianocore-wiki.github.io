# GCC Shell

<b><i>Note: this package has been deprecated. Please refer to
[Shell](Shell) and
[ShellPkg](../../platforms-packages/core-packages/ShellPkg.md) for

## Welcome to the gcc-shell project

The purpose of this project is to provide the ability to build the
[efi-shell](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=EFI_Shell)
project in the [EDK
II](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=EDK2)
for the ARM processor type, and for all processor types with GCC.
Currently you can build the
[efi-shell](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=EFI_Shell)
in the [EDK
II](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=EDK2)
with the Edk Compatibility Package, but it does not support ARM or GCC.
Since adding ARM and GCC support required modifying the
[efi-shell](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=EFI_Shell)
code in a way that is not compatible with the efi-shell project this new
project was added.

The current gcc-shell project is based on the
[efi-shell](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=EFI_Shell)
project Subversion revision 34.

## Short Lived Project

It is intended that this project will have a short life. The long term
goal is to have a pure EDK II shell. When an EDK II shell is available
this project will be retired.

## Getting Started

This section assumes you have the
[edk2](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=EDK2)
checked out into the edk directory. Use Subversion to check out the
GccShellPkg in the edk2 directory with the following commands:

    cd edk2
    svn co https://gcc-shell.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gcc-shell/trunk/GccShellPkg  GccShellPkg

On Windows binary copies of the tools are checked into source control.
On Unix like systems the tools must be built. So do the following to
build the tools on a Unix like system. You should only need to do this
one time after you checked the code out from source control:

    ~/work/edk2$  make -C BaseTools/Source/C

Follow the [OS specific
instructions](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tianocore/index.php?title=Step-by-step_instructions)
to setup your build environment, and build a gcc compiler if needed. For
Windows edksetup.bat, for Unix like systems you need to source
edksetup.sh. Then you can build the shell from the edk2 directory. You
only need to execute the edksetup script one time in you terminal
window:

Windows with RVCT: Shell binary:
edk2/Build/GccShellPkg/DEBUG_RVCT31/IA32/ShellFull.efi

    C:\edk2> edksetup.bat
    C:\edk2> build -p GccShellPkg/GccShellPkg.dsc -a ARM -t RVCT31

Windows Cygwin Bash shell with RVCT: Shell binary:
edk2/Build/GccShellPkg/DEBUG_RVCT31CYGWIN/IA32/ShellFull.efi

    ~/work/edk2$  . edksetup.sh BaseTools
    ~/work/edk2$  build -p GccShellPkg/GccShellPkg.dsc -a ARM -t RVCT31CYGWIN

OS X with Xcode tools example: Shell binary:
edk2/Build/GccShellPkg/DEBUG_XCODE32/IA32/ShellFull.efi

    ~/work/edk2$  . edksetup.sh BaseTools
    ~/work/edk2$  build -p GccShellPkg/GccShellPkg.dsc -a IA32 -t XCODE32

Linux with GCC tools example: Shell binary:
edk2/Build/GccShellPkg/DEBUG_ELFGCC/X64/ShellFull.efi

    ~/work/edk2$  . edksetup.sh BaseTools
    ~/work/edk2$  build -p GccShellPkg/GccShellPkg.dsc -a X64 -t ELFGCC

## Run gcc-shell in UnixPkg

    cd edk2/UnixPkg
    vi UnixPkg.fdf

Update the Flash Description File (.fdf) to point to the GccShellPkg
binary we just built. Note path will change based on the compiler you
used:

            SECTION PE32 = EdkShellBinPkg/FullShell/Ia32/Shell_Full.efi
    #        SECTION PE32 =Build/GccShellPkg/DEBUG_XCODE32/IA32/ShellFull.efi

To:

    #        SECTION PE32 = EdkShellBinPkg/FullShell/Ia32/Shell_Full.efi
            SECTION PE32 =Build/GccShellPkg/DEBUG_XCODE32/IA32/ShellFull.efi

Now build the UnixPkg to include the shell we can source level debug:

    ./build.sh

Run the UnixPkg emulator:

    $ ./build.sh run
    Building from: /Users/fish/work/Migration/edk2
    using prebuilt tools
    Reading symbols for shared libraries ...... done
    Breakpoint 1 at 0xce84: file /Users/fish/work/Migration/edk2/UnixPkg/Sec/SecMain.c, line 1070.
    (gdb)

Type r and hit return at the gdb prompt to start the emulator. Let the
UnixPkg emulator run until it boots the EFI Shell (gcc-shell) and break
into gdb with a ctrl-c. Your gdb back trace might vary, depending on
where you broke in, but you should see symbols for the EFI-Shell. The
current UnixPkg uses an EFI shell binary that was produced with Visual
Studio so no symbols will be shown if you use that one.

You can see by calls to InitializeShell() and NShellPrompt() that the
shell supports source level debugging.

The UnixPkg should produce an X11 window that is the emulated EFI
graphics console containing a shell prompt. Do the ctrl-c after you see
the shell prompt

## Common Errors

     build.py...
     : error 1005: There are 2 INF files in /Users/fish/work/edk2/GccShellPkg.
        Please use '-m <INF_FILE_PATH>' switch to choose one.

If you build from the edk2/GccShellPkg directory you need to pick either
Shell.inf or ShellFull.inf. If you cd up to the edk2 directory this
build error will go away and both .inf files will be built.

     'c:/Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
     operable program or batch file.
     NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"c:/Program Files/ARM/RVCT/Programs/3.1/761/win_32-pentium/armcc"' : return code '0x1'

The default location of the RVCT compiler is not correct. Edit
edk2/Conf/tools_def.txt and update the line that starts with DEFINE
RVCT31_TOOLS_PATH to match the location of your RVCT install.

The default location of the RVCT compiler is not correct. Edit

RVCT31CYGWIN_TOOLS_PATH to match the location of your RVCT install.

     edk2/Conf/tools_def.txt file does not exist

This file is not checked into source control. When you setup your build
environment the first time edk2/BaseTools/Conf/tools_def.template gets
copied to edk2/Conf/tools_def.txt. This allows you to make local
modification to match the locations of the compilers installed on your
system without having to check that back into source control. If
edk/Conf/tools_def.txt exists it will not get overwritten. So you should
only have to change it one time.

You forgot to build the GccShellPkg. Follow the instructions in
[Getting Started](Getting_Started) to build the GccShellPkg.
You do not need to checkout the GccShellPkg from subversion again if you
have already done it once.
