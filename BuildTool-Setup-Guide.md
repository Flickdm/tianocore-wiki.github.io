## GitHub EDK II Project Repositories

- The EDK II BaseTools are part of the EDK II project repository.
- The EDK II project repository is available at
  <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2>.
- Prebuilt Windows tools are available at
  <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32>.
- Content that is not released under an accepted open source license can
  be found at <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-non-osi>.

# Getting the extra tools

## Compiler

For both the BuildTools and [EDK II](http://www.tianocore.org/edk2/)
projects, you will need to obtain a compiler from somewhere else. These
instructions do not cover obtaining or installation of a compiler tools
chain. The BaseTools build requires a C compiler; an assembler or ACPI
assembler are not required to build tools in this project. BaseTools
assume that a compiler is already configured in the environment.

## Python

The BaseTools build supports the Makefile based build for EDK II. All
Tools are written in either C or Python. The C tools must compile on all
operating systems with various compilers, so the code is written using
simple, standard functions and libraries. The Python-based tools are
written assuming the features that were available in Python. GUI
applications can be created in Python, using the wxPython package and
all Python applications can be converted to run under a native OS
(Windows, Linux or OS/X.) via the
<a href="Python_Tools" class="wikilink" title="Python Tools">Python
Tools</a>.

The tools in this section are NOT required to build the EDK II project;
they are needed to compile the BaseTools used to build the EDK II
project.

- Linux and OS/X developers using a command line, create a directory
  that will be used to hold the files, then change to that directory.
  - Replace URL with apropriate one from
    <a href="Python_Tools" class="wikilink" title="Python Tools">Python
    Tools</a>. Installation and configuration for these tools are left
    to the developer.

Refer to documentation in either the UserManuals or Source folders for
more information.

  Manuals](https://github.com/tianocore/buildtools-BaseTools/tree/master/UserManuals)
