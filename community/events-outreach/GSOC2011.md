## News

- Here is the [official GSoC 2011
  timeline](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2011)

### Thanks to coreboot

Thanks to the [coreboot](http://www.coreboot.org/) project for donating
2 GSoC project slots to tianocore, which will enable us to pursue 2
additional projects as part of GSoC!

## Students

### Getting Started

Google has posted some useful [DOs and DON'Ts for
students](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/03/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code.html).

Aside from Google's recommendations, here are some things you should
look over before starting the main work on your project:

1. Review our
    [Code Style](development/coding-standards/code_style.md)
    - Including the parts about commit messages and commit partitioning.
2. (Optional) Complete the process to become a
    [Basic Contributor](governance/membership-roles/member_types.md#Basic_Contributor) if you'd like to be
    able to contribute code into our edk2 tree.
3. Determine where you are going to initially host your code
    - Your mentor will want to see progress on your project every few
      days, and this will be much easier in a separate project
    - Determine which source control system you will use. Subversion
      would be a good first choice. Git could be an options as well.
      (You'll want to include your mentor in this choice.)
    - Some code hosting options:
      [google](http://code.google.com/hosting),
      [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net),
      [github](https://github.com/)

### Working on the Project

Here are some recommendations for use during the summer while working on
your project:

1. [Commit early, commit
    often](http://www.google.com/search?q=commit+early+commit+often)
    - Besides being a good practice in general, this will allow your
      mentor to see your progress.
    - Proper [Commit Partitioning](development/contribution-guides/commit_partitioning.md) can allow you
      to check in changes up to several per day.
2. Ask questions earlier rather than later.
    - Use the
      [edk2-devel](edk2-devel)
      list first, and your mentor second. You should interact with our
      community as much as possible.
    - Questions are good. Perhaps it'll point out some documentation
      that we need for our community.
3. Create a timeline with some intermediate goals for your project.
    - Discuss the situation with your mentor if you need to adjust your
      goals.
4. Don't copy source code, except from the main [EDK
    II](http://www.tianocore.org/edk2/) tree.
    - If you think some BSD licensed code from another project is
      required, make sure you discuss it with your mentor and jljusten.
5. If you have an issue, and your mentor is not able to help you, then
    contact jljusten.

## Mentors

1. Be sure to look over Google's [DOs and DON'Ts for
    mentors](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/04/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code_21.html).
2. Review the student section above
3. Monitor your students work in their source repository
    - If you are not seeing regular updates, make sure your student is
      not getting into trouble
    - You should be in communication with your student, or seeing good
      results in their source repository at least every few days (at a
      minimum).
4. If you have an issue, please contact jljusten.
