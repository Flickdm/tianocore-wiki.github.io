This page describes how the this site and associated sites work.

The goal is to document for support and enable an opensource model for
managing the site.

The Tianocore project is the front end to the other projects. Each major
project is its own project at sourceforge The Tianocore project hosts
the mediawiki hosted app and the mailing list hosted app.

if you know a better way to do this please let us know because even the
site is open source ;-)
