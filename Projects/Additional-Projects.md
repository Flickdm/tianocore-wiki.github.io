# Additional Projects

[EDK II](../reference/external-resources/EDK-II.md) is a modern, feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development environment for the [UEFI](http://uefi.org) and PI specifications. Click for a list of [EDK II Documents](../reference/external-resources/EDK-II-Documents.md) and [EDK II Specifications](../reference/specs-standards/EDK-II-Specifications.md).

## EDK II Projects

* UEFI Development Kit 2017 ([UDK2017](../releases-history/archives/UDK2017.md)) is a stable release of portions of [EDK II](../reference/external-resources/EDK-II.md).
* [edk2-buildtools](../build-tooling/build-workflows/Edk2-buildtools.md) are the primary set of tools for processing EDK II content.
* [ShellPkg](../platforms-packages/core-packages/ShellPkg.md) is a UEFI 2.0 Shell implementation.
* The [[EDK II Application Development Kit (EADK)|EDKII-EADK]] includes Standard C Libraries in UEFI Shell Applications (replacement for the EFI Toolkit).
* [[UEFI Driver Developer Resources for EDK II|Driver-Developer]] support UEFI driver development by independent hardware vendors (IHV), including the UEFI Driver Wizard and UEFI Driver Writers Guide (DWG).
* [edk2-fat-driver](../platforms-packages/component-guides/edk2-fat-driver.md) is a driver for the FAT12/16/32 filesystems.
* [gcc-shell](../build-tooling/environment-setup/Gcc-shell.md) is a port of the older EFI shell to add GCC build support and ARM processor support.
* [[EDK II Security Package|SecurityPkg]] and other security information.
* Open [Tasks](../governance/project-management/Tasks.md) suggested by the EDK II community.
* [[Coreboot UEFI Payload|Coreboot_UEFI_payload]] open community project.
* [EDK II Build Data Viewer](https://github.com/01org/edkiibuilddataviewer) project at 01.org
* [MicroPython Test Framework for UEFI](../platforms-packages/tooling-utilities/MicroPython-Test-Framework-for-UEFI.md) - framework for unit testing and test automation, based on a port of [MicroPython](../development/tutorials-howto/MicroPython.md) to UEFI for a lightweight and minimalist implementation.

### [EDK II Platforms](../platforms-packages/platform-ports/EDK-II-Platforms.md)

### Events and Hack-a-thons

TianoCore technical sessions and workshops are featured at a variety of conferences. Hack-a-thons are in-person events designed to encourage developer feedback on TianoCore projects and features. These are typically associated with, or adjacent to, other firmware-related conferences.

* [OSFC 2018](../community/events-outreach/OSFC-2018.md) - Open Source Firmware Conference. Sept 12-15, 2018. Erlangen, Germany.
* [YVR 2018](../community/events-outreach/YVR-2018.md) - Linaro Connect. Sept 17-21, 2018. Vancouver, BC.
