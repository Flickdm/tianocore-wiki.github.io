# Additional Projects

[EDK II](../reference/external-resources/edk_ii.md) is a modern, feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development
environment for the [UEFI](http://uefi.org) and PI specifications. Click for a list of [EDK II
Documents](../reference/external-resources/edk_ii_documents.md) and [EDK II
Specifications](../reference/specs-standards/edk_ii_specifications.md).

## EDK II Projects

* UEFI Development Kit 2017 ([UDK2017](../releases-history/archives/udk2017.md)) is a stable release of portions of [EDK
  II](../reference/external-resources/edk_ii.md).
* [edk2-buildtools](../build-tooling/build-workflows/edk2_buildtools.md) are the primary set of tools for processing EDK
  II content.
* [ShellPkg](../platforms-packages/core-packages/shell_pkg.md) is a UEFI 2.0 Shell implementation.
* The [EDK II Application Development Kit (EADK)](../platforms-packages/core-packages/edkii_eadk.md)
  includes Standard C Libraries in UEFI Shell Applications (replacement for the EFI Toolkit).
* [UEFI Driver Developer Resources for EDK II](../development/tutorials-howto/driver_developer.md)
  support UEFI driver development by independent hardware vendors (IHV), including the UEFI Driver Wizard and UEFI
  Driver Writers Guide (DWG).
* [edk2-fat-driver](../platforms-packages/component-guides/edk2_fat_driver.md) is a driver for the FAT12/16/32
  filesystems.
* [gcc-shell](../build-tooling/environment-setup/gcc_shell.md) is a port of the older EFI shell to add GCC build support
  and ARM processor support.
* [EDK II Security Package](../platforms-packages/core-packages/security_pkg.md) and other security information.
* Open [Tasks](../governance/project-management/tasks.md) suggested by the EDK II community.
* [Coreboot UEFI Payload](../platforms-packages/platform-ports/coreboot_uefi_payload.md) open community project.
* [EDK II Build Data Viewer](https://github.com/01org/edkiibuilddataviewer) project at 01.org
* [MicroPython Test Framework for UEFI](../platforms-packages/tooling-utilities/micropython_test_framework_for_uefi.md)
  * framework for unit testing and test automation, based on a port of
    [MicroPython](../development/tutorials-howto/micropython.md) to UEFI for a lightweight and minimalist implementation.

### [EDK II Platforms](../platforms-packages/platform-ports/edk_ii_platforms.md)

### Events and Hack-a-thons

TianoCore technical sessions and workshops are featured at a variety of conferences. Hack-a-thons are in-person events
designed to encourage developer feedback on TianoCore projects and features. These are typically associated with, or
adjacent to, other firmware-related conferences.

* [OSFC 2018](../community/events-outreach/osfc_2018.md) - Open Source Firmware Conference. Sept 12-15, 2018. Erlangen,
  Germany.
* [YVR 2018](../community/events-outreach/yvr_2018.md) - Linaro Connect. Sept 17-21, 2018. Vancouver, BC.
