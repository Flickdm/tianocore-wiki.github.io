NetworkPkg provides IPv6 network stack drivers, IPsec driver,
[PXE](PXE) driver, iSCSI driver
and necessary shell applications for network configuration

5\. Shell Applications

1\) NetworkPkg/Application/Ping6

- This command is used to ping the target host with IPv6 stack.

2\) NetworkPkg/Application/IfConfig6

- This command is used to configure the default IP address of the UEFI
  IPv6.

3\) NetworkPkg/Application/IpSecConfig

- This command is used to create, edit and delete the IPsec policy, i.e.
  Security Policy Database (SPD), Security Association Database (SAD),
  and Peer Authentication Database (PAD).

4\) NetworkPkg/Application/VConfig

- This command is used to configure VLAN of a network interface.

Note: UNDI, SNP, DPC and MNP drivers are components shared by IPv4
network stack and IPv6 network stack. These modules could be found in
MdeModulePkg except the UNDI driver. For UNDI driver, please contact the
Card Vendor.

Note: The PXE driver (NetworkPkg/UefiPxeBcDxe) supports boot on both
IPv4 and IPv6 network stack.

Note: Supported features in IPsec

- 1\) Security Protocols Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
- 2\) IPsec Mode Transport/Tunnel mode
- 3\) Encryption Algorithm 3DES-CBC, AES-CBC
- 4\) Authentication Algorithm HMAC_SHA1_96
- 5\) Authentication Method Pre-shared Key, X509 Certificates

Note: After IPsec is enabled in both side, all inbound and outbound IP
packet are processed by IPsec.
