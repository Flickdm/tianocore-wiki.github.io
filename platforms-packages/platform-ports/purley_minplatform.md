EDK II platform firmware for the Open Compute Project (OCP) [Intel XSP
Motherboard](http://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Server/ProjectOlympus#Project_Olympus_Server_Motherboards). Based on the
[Intel Xeon Scalable Processor](https://ark.intel.com/products/series/125191/Intel-Xeon-Scalable-Processors) family
(formerly codenamed "Purley").

This tree follows a "minimum platform" philosophy, providing boot to a UEFI compliant operating system using the minimum
number of EDK II modules. The project uses binaries in the [edk2-non-osi](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-non-osi.git)
repository for platform silicon initialization.
