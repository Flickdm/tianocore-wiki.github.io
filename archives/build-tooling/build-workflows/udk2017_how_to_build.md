## HOW TO BUILD (WINDOWS SYSTEM)

The steps below are verified on Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise*:

1. Setup Build Environment
    1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2015* in the build machine and make
       sure that AMD64 complier was selected when installing.
    2. Download NASM 2.0.7 or later from [http://www.nasm.us/](http://www.nasm.us/) and install it to
       C:\Nasm. Make sure C:\Nasm is added to system environment variable 'PATH'
    3. Set up for using GitHub for Windows. See:
       [../../../development/tutorials-howto/getting_started_with_edk_ii.md#github-help](../../../development/tutorials-howto/getting_started_with_edk_ii.md#github-help)
    4. Download and install Python2.7.x  [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/) for building the BaseTools
       Default install directory is: C:/Python27

2. Create the full Source Code directory for the UDK2017 release
    1. Create a working space directory in the build machine, for example, C:\MyWorkspace
    2. Download the official UDK2017 release .zip file from the [UDK2017 Release
       Page](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/vUDK2017)
        1. Download - UDK2017 edk-vUDK2017 Workspace [Source code (zip
           file)](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/archive/vUDK2017.zip)
        2. Extract files in [edk2-vUDK2017] to the working space directory C:\MyWorkspace.
    3. **OR**  Checkout the vUDK2017 Tag from GitHub with the following "git" command
        1. run  `git clone  https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git vUDK2017`
        2. Move all files and folders under "vUDK2017" to "C:\MyWorkspace"
    4. **Optional** (See _Compile the BaseTools_ below) Checkout BaseTools binaries and copy them to BaseTools binary
       folder. Warning the Windows* Binary tools are only valid for the tip of the
       [https://github.com/tianocore/edk2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) repository.
        1. `Cd C:\MyWorkspace`
        2. Run `git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32.git`
        3. Enter folder edk2-BaseTools-win32
        4. Run the command `git checkout 0e088c19ab31fccd1d2f55d9e4fe0314b57c0097`
        5. `Cd C:\MyWorkSpace`
        6. Rename this folder from edk2-BaseTools-win32 to win32, then copy the win32
           directory into the BaseTools/Bin directory under the workspace.
           (e.g. "C:\MyWorkspace\BaseTools\Bin\")
3. Generate OpenSSL* Crypto Library
    1. Open file "C:\MyWorkspace\CryptoPkg\Library\OpensslLib\OpenSSL-HOWTO.txt"
       and follow the instruction to install OpenSSL* for UEFI building.
       For this release, please use OpenSSL-1.1.0e.

4. Compile the BaseTools (Skip if Optional Step 2.iv was done above) See:
   [../../../build-tooling/environment-setup/windows_systems.md#compile-tools](../../../build-tooling/environment-setup/windows_systems.md#compile-tools)
    1. Open a Microsoft Visual Studio* command prompt, type `cd C:\MyWorkspace`
       to enter the  workspace directory
    2. Compile the BaseTools C source tools

    ```batch
    set PYTHON_HOME=C:\Python27
    set EDK_TOOLS_PATH=%CD%\BaseTools
    BaseTools\toolssetup.bat Rebuild
    ```

5. Build Steps

    _**NT32**_

    1. Open a Microsoft Visual Studio* command prompt, type `cd C:\MyWorkspace`
       to enter the workspace directory
    2. Use edksetup.bat command to initialize the working environment.
       `edksetup --nt32`
    3. Type following command to build Nt32 platform
       `build -t VS2015x86`
    4. Upon the build completing successfully there should be the UEFI Application "`HelloWorld.efi`" in the
       C:\MyWorkspace\Build\MdeModule\DEBUG_VS2015x86\IA32 directory

## HOW TO BUILD (LINUX-LIKE SYSTEM)

The below steps are verified on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Desktop*:

1. Setup Build Environment
    1. Follow instructions for setting up the build environment on tianocore.org.
       "[Using EDK II with Native GCC](../../../build-tooling/environment-setup/using_edk_ii_with_native_gcc.md)"
    2. Please notice that here the root is `"~/src/MyWorkspace"` instead
       of `"~/src/edk2"`
    3. Make sure BaseTools is built and required software like iASL compiler
       are installed. Some operations need switch to user "root" to execute.
       At Ubuntu, you can type `"sudo apt-get install git"` under terminal prompt "Cnt-Alt-T" to
       install git.
    4. Install NASM 2.0.7 or later.
       At Ubuntu, you can type `"sudo apt-get install nasm"` under terminal prompt to
       install it.
       You can also download the source package from [http://www.nasm.us/](http://www.nasm.us/) and
       install it following the instruction on the website.
    5. Install IASL 20150818 or later.
       At Ubuntu, you can type `"sudo apt-get install iasl"` under terminal prompt to
       install it.
       You can also download the source package from [https://acpica.org/downloads](https://acpica.org/downloads)
       and install it following the instruction on the website.
    6. Install the C Compiler- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  you can use GNU C compiler (v5.4.0)
       At Ubuntu, you can type `"sudo apt-get install gcc-5"` under terminal prompt to install it.

2. Create the full Source Code directory for the UDK2017 release
    1. Create a working space directory in the build machine, for example, ~/src/MyWorkspace
    2. Download the official UDK2017 release .tar file from the [UDK2017 Release
       Page](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/vUDK2017)
        1. Download - UDK2017 edk-vUDK2017 Workspace [Source code (tar.gz
           file)](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/archive/vUDK2017.tar.gz)
        2. Extract files in [edk2-vUDK2017] to the working space directory ~/src/MyWorkspace.
    3. **OR**  Checkout the vUDK2017 tag from GitHub with the following "git" command
        1. Run `"git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git vUDK2017"`
        2. Move all files and folders under "vUDK2017" to "~/src/MyWorkspace"

3. Generate OpenSSL* Crypto Library
    1. Open file "~/src/MyWorkspace/CryptoPkg/Library/OpensslLib/OpenSSL-HOWTO.txt"
       and follow the instruction to install OpenSSL* for UEFI building.
       For this release, please use OpenSSL-1.1.0e.

4. Build Steps

    _**MdeModulePkg**_

    1. Open a terminal and type `"cd ~/src/MyWorkspace"` to enter the workspace
       directory.
    2. First build the BaseTools by typing
       `"make -C BaseTools"`
    3. Initialize the build environment by typing
       `". edksetup.sh"`.
    4. Type following command to build platforms using GCC v5.4.0
       `"build  -p MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc -t GCC5"`
    5. Upon the build completing successfully there should be the UEFI Application "`HelloWorld.efi`" in the
       ~/src/MyWorkspace/Build/MdeModule/DEBUG_GCC5/IA32 directory
