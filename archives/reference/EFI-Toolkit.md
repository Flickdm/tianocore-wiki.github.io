# EFI Toolkit

The [EDKII-EADK](EDKII-EADK)
is replacing the EFI Toolkit. It is recommended that you use this EDK II
Project instead of the EFI Toolkit since it is no longer supported.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Unmaintained project for reference only

The EFI Toolkit is a set of tools that support rapid porting and
development of EFI applications, and promote a uniform pre-boot
environment on 32 and 64 bit based platforms. The components are
released as reference source code. Some components are meant to be stand
alone and run on UEFI/EFI compliant systems and some components will
require running on the EFI shell. The EFI Toolkit is released under the
[BSD License](../../reference/legal-licenses/BSD-License.md), and the Python code is released
under [PSF
License](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.4/license/).

Working with the EFI Toolkit

The EFI Toolkit package enables rapid development of EFI based
applications, protocols, device drivers, EFI shells, and OS loaders on
IA-32, IA-64(IPF) and Intel 64(EM64T or X64) platforms. It provides
libraries and samples for using native EFI services, as well as
portability libraries that make it easy to port or write Unix/POSIX
style programs.
