### Enable Clang/LLVM Build for Microsoft Windows

[https://llvm.org/](https://llvm.org/) support in
[EDK II](../reference/external-resources/edk_ii.md) is currently
limited to Linux builds. Getting LLVM running on Windows would enable
the TianoCore project to support Clang and the LLVM toolchain more
robustly. Microsoft Windows 10 should be the primary target.

### Optimize OVMF for Xen HVM domains

Add Xen specific support in
[OVMF](../platforms-packages/platform-ports/ovmf.md) to improve boot &
runtime performance. [http://www.xen.org/](http://www.xen.org/)

### Port EmulatorPkg to Windows

Port [EmulatorPkg](../platforms-packages/platform-ports/emulator_pkg.md) to Microsoft Windows (32/64 bit), as
a replacement for [NT32](platforms-packages/nt32_pkg.md).

- Difficulty: Medium

### Add Visual Studio 2017 Support

Microsoft Visual Studio will be released March 7, 2017. Add VS2017 build
support to EDK II.

### Port Intel Firmware Engine SDK Extensions to OVMF

Intel Firmware Engine adds UserExtensions in the SDK to describe
connections between modules and module parameters (as "Patchable In
Binary" PCDs). This enables binary distribution of configurable firmware
components. Porting these extensions to a branch of OVMF would allow
development and testing of these concepts on a virtual platform.
