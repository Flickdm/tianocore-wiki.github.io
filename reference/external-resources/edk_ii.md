## Additional Information

### UDK Releases

UEFI Development Kit ([UDK](../../releases-history/archives/udk.md)) releases pre-date the introduction of the stable
tag, occur less frequently, and have a longer validation cycle. These are based on validation using various platforms.
The year tag indicates the year of major specifications used for the release.
