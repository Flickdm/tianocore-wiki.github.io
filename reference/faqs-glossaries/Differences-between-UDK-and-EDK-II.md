# Differences Between Udk And Edk Ii

**Frequently asked questions about the differences between [UDK](../../releases-history/archives/UDK.md) i.e. [UDK2017](../../releases-history/archives/UDK2017.md) and EDK II**

### What is the difference between UDK and EDK II?

* [EDK II](../external-resources/EDK-II.md) is the open source project for which volunteers (contributors) participate in development. The tip of this project is being developed and updated constantly for fixes and enhancements.
* The [UDK](../../releases-history/archives/UDK.md) releases are NOT maintained by volunteer. Each UDK release is a fully validated implementation by Intel for a specific revision of the EDK II source. The latest [UDK](../../releases-history/archives/UDK.md) Release Notes denotes the git revision used for each of the validated [UDK](../../releases-history/archives/UDK.md) release.
* The [UDK](../../releases-history/archives/UDK.md) release contains a validated subset of the packages available from the EDK II project.

### How do other 3rd party companies use [UDK](../../releases-history/archives/UDK.md)?

* Other 3rd party companies, including BIOS vendors use the UEFI conformance BIOS implementation based on the UDK release which Intel validates.
* See also the Intel UEFI community for more information [https://software.intel.com/en-us/firmware/](https://software.intel.com/en-us/firmware/)

### [UDK](../../releases-history/archives/UDK.md) is stable

* It is NOT “always changed.” The last release of [UDK](../../releases-history/archives/UDK.md) was [UDK2017](../../releases-history/archives/UDK2017.md) June 2017.
* The NEXT release of [UDK](../../releases-history/archives/UDK.md) is being discussed and will include any updates those that use it have requested to be included. The release cadence will likely be, perhaps, once every six months – completely dependent upon what feedback comes in from the open source community and customers that use it.
