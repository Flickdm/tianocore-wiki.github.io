# Infosec GHSA Process Proposal

Roles & Responsibilities:

* *Reporter*
  * Responsibility:
    1. Submits a `potential vulnerability` to the Infosec group
* *Remediation Coordinator*
  * Responsibility:
    1. Coordinates the community
        * Finds a *remediation developer*
        * Finds (ideally) 2x *Remediation Reviewers*
    2. Acts as the one voice for responding to the *Reporter*
    3. Should be a [Tianocore Owner](https://github.com/orgs/tianocore/people?query=role%3Aowner) or coordinate with one. They are the only ones who can create a new GHSA
* *Remediation Developer*
  * Responsibility:
    1. Patching the vulnerability
    2. Testing the patch
        * Must write up what tests they've ran and include information about Platforms / Conditions / Environment
* *Remediation Reviewer*
  * Responsibility:
    1. *Subject matter experts* (SMEs) that should be available to answer questions posed by the *remediation developer*
    2. Testing the patch
        * Must write up what tests they've ran and include information about Platforms / Conditions / Environment
* *Package Maintainer*
  * Responsibility:
    1. The final shepard of the patch from the advisory branch to main
* *Security Advisory Writer*
    1. This may be the same as the *Remediation Coordinator*
    2. Either a maintainer or a member of this group may create a target branch and approve merge to it
    3. Needs to be a member of [Security Advisory Writer](https://github.com/orgs/tianocore/teams/security-advisory-writers/members)

## Stages

The following are the stages that a vulnerability goes through until being patched.

### Stage: Report

A Security Advisory begins when a **reporter** reports a vulnerability.

A `Reporter` will hit the `Security` tab on [Edk2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/security) to begin.

![Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/blob/master/images/infosec_ghsa_report_a_vulnerability.png)

Now the `Reporter` can begin submitting vulnerability details.
![Vulnerability Details](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/blob/master/images/infosec_ghsa_submit_vulnerability_details.png)

At this point the `Reporter` is waiting for response from the EDK2 Info Sec group.

Alternatively a report may be given by VINCE. In that case, the reporter should be directed
to the github security page to submit the security issue for internal tracking.

### Stage: Triage

When a new CVE is identified, a `Remediation Coordinator` must be designated.

The `Remediation Coordinator` must then find the following:

1. `Remediation Developer`
2. 2x `Remediation Reviewers` (ideally SMEs of the patch in the Infosec community)

The `Remediation Developer` must find developers either within their own organization or within the Infosec community.

Once these roles are filled, the process can move on to the `Fix` stage.

If the submission is not found to be a CVE, the `Remediation Coordinator` must work with the submitter to close the issue. The `Reporter` is allowed to (and probably will) write up public documentation.

### Stage: Fix

During this stage, the `Remediation Coordinator` will inform the `Reporter` that the 180 day embargo has begun. The `Remediation Coordinator` should provide the `Reporter` with up-to-date information and be the **ONLY** voice discussing when patches will be available.

The `Remediation Coordinator` should then create a new GHSA and a temporary fork for the Advisory. Each Advisory will have exactly one fork that may contain multiple branches, forked from EDK2.

The `Remediation Developer` will perform their work and create a patch as soon as possible. If they have questions
they should contact the `Remediation Reviewers` ASAP.

The `Remediation Developer` must update the appropriate package [security vulnerabilities json](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/NetworkPkg/SecurityFixes.yaml) to indicate what is being patched.

Ideally this should be completed within 90 days. Leaving another 90 days at minimum for testing across a wide range of platforms and feedback.

### Stage: Review

When the `Remediation Developer` is ready for a review, they will create a review on the private fork targeting the primary branch.

The pipelines are not expected to work. To reduce the work that will need to take place in the public, the `Remediation Developer` should run as many CI checks locally as they can (formatting, etc).

Example: PatchCheck, Uncrustify, etc

During this stage, the `Remediation Reviewers` must be responsive. If one or both reviewers are unresponsive, the `Remediation Coordinator` should contact them as soon as possible. If unresponsiveness continues, the `Remediation Coordinator` should involve a maintainer to push the patch forward quickly.

The `Remediation Coordinator` should encourage the `Reporter` to review the patch and verify if they are able to reproduce the original vulnerability.

The review will be considered complete when both `Remediation Reviewers` or `maintainer` have accepted the patch. If two Remediation reviewers could not be found, then a maintainer may act as the additional or final approver.

### Stage: Publish

Once the review is complete, and the team is ready to publish. The rest should follow in quick succession (1 Day)

The `Remediation Coordinator` must work with (or be a) `Security Advisory Writer` or a maintainer to create a branch that follows the format "/security-advisory/cve-xxx-xxxx/advisory".

This special branch will not be the final destination but simply a means to publish the branch so that the community can be advised and comment. However this branch must be merged in within 24 hours.

Next, the `Remediation Developer` should target the new branch. Then the Remediation Developer may close their previous reviewed PR that was targeting master.

The `Security Advisory Writer` or `Remediation Coordination` or `Maintainer` may merge the new branch. Then `Remediation Coordinator` may then publish the GHSA and credit the appropriate parties.

### Stage: Merge

The final stage is to merge the patch into the primary branch. Here the *Remediation developer* will create a [pull request against](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/pull/10928) the primary branch. Any final CI issues should be address and the community has 24 hours to comment before being merged in.

Once merged the process is complete.
