# Code Reviews

Code reviews are a critical part of producing high quality code. This
page documents how to use code reviews within our projects, and how to
be a code reviewer.

# Submit Code

<a href="Code_Contributions#Submitting_Contributions" class="wikilink"
title="Submit your patch">Submit your patch</a> to GitHub as a pull
request.

# Review Code

As a member of the community, please take the time to review pull
requests.

If you find issues, and think the code should be modified and
re-reviewed before being used, leave comments in the pull request to
explain what you think needs to be changed.

If you think the code is reasonable for use, then approve the pull
request.

If you think only minor modifications are required, then you can approve
the pull request, but also leave feedback for the minor changes you
think are needed. The author will need to mark those feedback items as
resolved before the pull request can be completed.

and force push to your fork branch to update the pull request.
