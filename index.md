# Welcome to TianoCore

Welcome to TianoCore, the community supporting an open source implementation of
[UEFI](reference/specs-standards/uefi.md).

[EDK II](reference/external-resources/edk_ii.md) is a modern,
feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development environment for the UEFI and
[PI](reference/specs-standards/pi.md) specifications.

We hope that you’ll delve into our work, use TianoCore for
platform firmware, [Report Issues](community/support-onboarding/reporting_issues.md) that you find, and
contribute to the community. Learn more on
[TianoCore - Who We Are](community/support-onboarding/tianocore_who_we_are.md).

The latest [stable tag](reference/external-resources/edk_ii.md#stable-tags) of EDK II is
[edk2-stable202508](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/edk2-stable202508).

If you want to compile firmware or utilities, we recommend the [Getting Started with EDK
II](development/tutorials-howto/getting_started_with_edk_ii.md) page. This provides an overview of downloading
[EDK II from GitHub](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) and building a sample platform
([OVMF](platforms-packages/platform-ports/ovmf.md),
[EmulatorPkg](platforms-packages/platform-ports/emulator_pkg.md),
[MdePkg](platforms-packages/core-packages/mde_pkg.md), ...). There are multiple
[hardware platforms](platforms-packages/platform-ports/edk_ii_platforms.md) using EDK II open source UEFI firmware,
including MinnowBoard Max/Turbot, Aaeon UpSquared, and Intel® Galileo Gen 2. This allows you to experiment and develop
UEFI features on real hardware.

TianoCore uses github issues to track issues and feature requests. Please review [Reporting
Issues](community/support-onboarding/reporting_issues.md) and [Reporting Security
Issues](security/processes/reporting_security_issues.md) for more information. If you would like to contribute
code or fix issues, please see [How To Contribute](development/contribution-guides/how_to_contribute.md) along
with our [Inclusive Language Guidelines](governance/charter-policies/inclusive_language_guidelines.md). The
[Tasks](governance/project-management/tasks.md) page has a list of priority work items.
