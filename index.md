Welcome to TianoCore, the community supporting an open source implementation of [UEFI](../../reference/specs-standards/UEFI.md).
[EDK II](../../reference/external-resources/EDK-II.md) is a modern, feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development environment for the UEFI and [PI](../../reference/specs-standards/PI.md) specifications. We hope that you’ll delve into our work, use TianoCore for platform firmware, [[report any issues|Reporting Issues]] you find, and contribute to the community. Learn more on [TianoCore Who we are](../../community/support-onboarding/TianoCore-Who-we-are.md).

The latest [stable tag](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/EDK-II#stable-tags) of EDK II is [edk2-stable202508](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/releases/tag/edk2-stable202508).

If you want to compile firmware or utilities, we recommend the [Getting Started with EDK II](../../development/tutorials-howto/Getting-Started-with-EDK-II.md) page. This provides an overview of downloading [EDK II from github](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) and building a sample platform ([OVMF](../../platforms-packages/platform-ports/OVMF.md), [EmulatorPkg](../../platforms-packages/platform-ports/EmulatorPkg.md), [MdePkg](../../platforms-packages/core-packages/MdePkg.md), ...). There are multiple [[hardware platforms|EDK II Platforms]] using EDK II open source UEFI firmware, including [[MinnowBoard Max/Turbot|MinnowBoardMax]], [[Aaeon UpSquared|IntelAtomProcessorE3900]], and [[Intel® Galileo Gen 2|Galileo]]. This allows you to experiment and develop UEFI features on real hardware.

TianoCore uses github issues to track issues and feature requests. Please review [Reporting Issues](../../community/support-onboarding/Reporting-Issues.md) and [Reporting Security Issues](../../security/processes/Reporting-Security-Issues.md) for more information. If you would like to contribute code or fix issues, please see [How To Contribute](../../development/contribution-guides/How-To-Contribute.md) along with our [Inclusive Language Guidelines](../../governance/charter-policies/Inclusive-Language-Guidelines.md). The [Tasks](../../governance/project-management/Tasks.md) page has a list of priority work items.
