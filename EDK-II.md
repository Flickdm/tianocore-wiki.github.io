## Additional Information

### UDK Releases

UEFI Development Kit ([UDK](UDK.md)) releases pre-date the introduction of the stable tag, occur less frequently, and have a longer validation cycle. These are based on validation using various platforms. The year tag indicates the year of major specifications used for the release.
